# A commen, this is so you can read your program later.
# Anything after the # is ignored by Python.

print("I could have code that looks like this.") # and the comment afterwards is ignored

# You can also use a comment to "disable" or comment out a piece of code:
# print "This won't run"

print "this will run"
