# Some calculation examples

print "I will now count my chickens:"

# Divides 30 with 6 than adds the result with 25
print "Hens: ", 25 + 30 / 6

# Multiplies 25 with 3 then extracts the modulus by 4 which is 3 and subtracts 3 from 100
print "Roosters: ", 100 - 25 * 3 % 4

print "Now I will count the eggs:"

# Divides 1 by 4 which results in 0, extracst the modulus by 2 from the numbers before, subtratcts result with 0 and adds 6
print 3 + 2 + 1 - 5 + 4 % 2 - 1.0 / 4.0 + 6

print "Is is it true that 3 + 2 < 5 - 7?"

print 3 + 2 < 5 - 7

print "What is 3 + 2? ", 3 + 2
print "What is 5 - 7? ", 5 - 7

print "Oh, that's why it's false!!"

print "How about some more?"

print "Is it greater? ", 5 > -2
print "Is it greater or equal ", 5 >= -2
print "Is it less or equal ", 5<= -2
